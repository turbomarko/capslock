Don't forget to mention:
- ideally these are separate repos
- auth missing
- I usually use 2 setups (reqs, docker, settings etc.), one for dev, one for prod, I only did the dev one
- The analytics service is based on turbo-drf
- We need to remove cmd or domething about it to work on a project level
- fixtures (either create them or delete everything related)
